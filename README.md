Linux on Arduino
===

This project tries to bring an ARM emulator to the Arduino Mega. If someone really wants, they can modify the source code to work on a smaller AVR using port expanders.

I have ported an ARM emulator originally designed for the ATmega1284p, so I am modifying it to work better with the Arduino mega (2650p).
